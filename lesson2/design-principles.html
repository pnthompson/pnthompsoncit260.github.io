                REI's home page show high contrast right off the bat. The REI logo and all the typography on the top of the page is white set against a black background. This makes it very easy to see. Next we can see that their advertisement for 50% off is large and
                in red. This makes it one of the first things that catches your eye. As you proceed further down the page, each item is set against a white background, which makes each of the items for sale stand out. REI has a clean and well contrasting
                site.

            <h2>White Space</h2>
            <p class="organization">
                Google <br>
                <a href="https://www.google.com/">www.google.com</a> </p><br>

                Google's homepage is the best example of using white space. It's simple, the centered, multi colored Google title is set just above their search bar. This is all set atop a white background. That is pretty much it. The genius of this design is that it
                is simple. When someone wants to search something they don't want to have to sift through news stories or pictures, they just want to see a search bar. This design is clean and effective. It's the reason most people use google to search
                things.

            <h2>Repetition</h2>

                Amazon <br>
                <a href="https://www.amazon.com/">www.amazon.com</a> </p><br>
            <figure>
                <img src="images/amazon.png" alt="amazon mobile device">

            </figure>
            <p>
                Amazon's page is speckled with small design elements that show continuity in throughout each page. One of the ways they do this is through repetition. Yellow is a big part of Amazons icon and overall theme. This same yellow is displayed all over each
                page, but not too much, just enough to let the consumer know that they are indeed on an Amazon page. It's found in the emblem, the search bar and in the various buttons. As you go to check out the yellow is even more prevelant.
